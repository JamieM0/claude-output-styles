# Claude Code Output Styles
I've had pretty good success with these claude code output styles (I'll update as I discover more, contributions are more than welcome).

My favourite one is the 'systematic bug fixer', it consistantly is able to identify the root cause of _most_ bugs I throw at it. Useful in combination with the 'bug hunter', which is basically a user focused code review (not as good as the bug fixer imo, but still better than vanilla claude code).
